# bubble-sort-visualization
This repository contains an interactive GUI application for visualizing and comparing the performance of three fundamental sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Bubble Sort. The application is built using Python and the tkinter library for the graphical interface.

How to Use:
    Clone the repository or download the code.
    Run the Python script to start the sorting visualization application.
    Use keyboard shortcuts (I, S, B) to select and visualize different sorting algorithms.
    Observe and compare the algorithms' performance in real time.
